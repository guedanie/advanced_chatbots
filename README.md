# Building Chatbots with Python

Chatbots are a really interesting topic to me, as they are a combination of advanced NLP tools, as well as powerful python code and proper "reactions" creation. Plus who wouldn't want to have their own Jarvis running the show...

For this repo, I will be following along a book called :Building Chatbots with Python" by Sumit Raj. 

THe objective of the book is to learn the basics of using chatbots by building unique intetions databases, and then using machine learning to train the chatbots. What I am really interested in though is that the book will also cover how to deploy your chatbots to other platforms (like Slack) so that other users can actually interact with your chatbots.
