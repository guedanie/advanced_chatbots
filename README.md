# Building Chatbots with Python

Chatbots are a really interesting topic to me, as they are a combination of advanced NLP tools, as well as powerful python code and proper "reactions" creation. Plus who wouldn't want to have their own Jarvis running the show...

For this repo, I will be following along a book called :Building Chatbots with Python" by Sumit Raj. 

THe objective of the book is to learn the basics of using chatbots by building unique intetions databases, and then using machine learning to train the chatbots. What I am really interested in though is that the book will also cover how to deploy your chatbots to other platforms (like Slack) so that other users can actually interact with your chatbots. 

## Tools used for building chatbots:

The book is divided into two sections. The first section will look to show the basic of building chatbots by using a google program called Dialogflow. Dialogflow allows users to build chatbots without actually writing code. The principle is to learn how to create intents and reponses, so that we can effectively train the models. 

For this section, we will be creating a chatbot that a user could use to order food online.
