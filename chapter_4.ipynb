    "# Chapter 4 - Building Chatbots the Hard Way\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using an open-source library called Rasa NLU for learning how to build chatbots from scratch without using any cloud services. Rasa NLU is a very sophisticated library and has lots of features in it. We are only going to touch upon the concepts and features that are important for us to build our chatbot. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Rasa NLU?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rasa NLU is an open-source NLP library for intent classification and entity extraction in chatbots. It helps you build and write custom NLP for chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of Rasa that we will be covering in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rasa NLU**: With Rasa NLU we'll be learning to prepare our training data for our chatbot, wirting configuration files, choosing a pipeline and training hte model. Lastly, we will be predicting the intent of a text using our model. We'll also be learning how to parse entities using Rasa NLU. \n",
    "* **Rasa Core**: In the second part we'll be learning to train the **Rasa Core** dialog management model to prepare responses back to the user. This section becomes very important when you have a variety of intents in your chatbot and their follow-up questions or reponses. Instead of writing lots of conditions in our decision tree and spending hours debugging it in case of a big enterprise-level application, it's better to teach the model to create responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why should I use Rasa NLU?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rasa NLU is not just any other library with a bunch of methods to do some things. It has the capability of building almost any kind of chatbot that you can imagine. Rasa brings you the magical capability of training the machine to understand the meaningof a text rather than you writing rules to understand it. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are some of the points on why we should use Rasa NLU:"
